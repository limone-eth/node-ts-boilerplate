# Spotify Downloader
This repo allows you to download tracks from Spotify at 320kbps.

What you need:
- Spotify Account (you need a CLIENT_ID and CLIENT_SECRET - https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/spotidy/vignettes/Connecting-with-the-Spotify-API.html')
- An API Key from https://rapidapi.com/tokcount-tokcount-default/api/spotify-downloader1

Once .env is filled out correctly, go in _src/spotify-down_ and edit the main() function according to your needs (e.g fill in the Spotify Playlist ID)

Then run: ```npm run start:ts```# node-ts-boilerplate
